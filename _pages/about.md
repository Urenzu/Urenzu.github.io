My research journey navigates the intersection of `Computer Vision` and its pivotal applications in enhancing `security systems` and advancing `autonomous systems`. At the heart of my work lies a dual mission: to fortify global security paradigms and to pioneer the infrastructural advancements necessary for humanity to transcend conventional tasks, thereby reallocating our collective focus towards pursuits that yield profound impact.

Currently a third-year undergraduate in the Department of `Computer Science and Engineering`, I am diligently working towards earning my `Bachelor of Science in Computer Science`. With an unwavering commitment to academic and professional growth, I am actively seeking `internship` opportunities for the Summer of 2024, I'll also be applying to `Masters`, and `Ph.D.` programs for the Fall of 2025, aiming to contribute significantly to the fields of `computer vision` and `autonomous systems`.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy and intellectual stimulation in delving into `research papers`, honing my programming skills through challenges on `Leetcode`, and maintaining physical wellness at the `gym`.
